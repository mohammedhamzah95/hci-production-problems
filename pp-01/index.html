    <h2 id="cin-head">Cinzel Medium</h2>
      <p id="cinzel">Cinzel is a typeface that is inspired by the Latin alphabet and similar to the Trajan font discussed in class.
        Cinzel is best used as headlines and has an ancient look but with a contemporary feel.
      </p>
    <h2>Fauna One</h2>
      <p id="fauna">
        Fauna One is a contemporary font that was designed by Eduardo Tunni. It can be used in headlines as well as paragraphs.
        It is composed of "low contrast strokes" that are similar to traditional serifs.
      </p>
    <h2>Embrace the Other</h2>
      <p id="explain">
        Cinzel and Fauna are two typefaces that blend the young and the old.
        A perfect balance of ancient art with modern ingenuity and simplicity.
        While Cinzel is bold and unmoving , Fauna is elegant and direct.
